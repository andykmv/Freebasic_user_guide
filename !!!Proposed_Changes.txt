"All of the source code..."
change: 
[store the files on freebasic.net maybe, where the clark productions website is located ?]
pp6 - pp13

CHAPTER_1
pp14 
- update para 1
- Integer's size
pp15
- suggest reverse the order of "Create.." as a begineer, mostly you just want to compile an exe (console) followed by simple gui after some experience
pp17 - re symbols...32/64 and size

CHAPTER_2
para2 "Table 3.1 lists all the numeric data types.." should be table 2.1.
update table 2.1 data types
udate table 2.2 data type suffixes

pp23 - para 1 referes to tBLW 3.1 LISTS ALL THE def STATEMENTS - IT SHOULD BE TABLE 2.3
PP24 USING DIF NU FORMATS - REFERS TO TABLE 3.4 SHOULD BE 2.4

CHAPTER_3
pp28 etc etc etc - change the font size of the "Analysis:" word (increase)
pp30 Analysis: refers to listing 4.2 - prob shld be 3.2
pp30 num data convs refs to table 4.1 shld be table 3.1
pp33 2nd last para also refers to table 4.1 shld be 3.1
pp35 i noticed that code is in a fixed width font "replacing x" wherease in the same paragraph Cint is normal text style rather than code style.  if the aforementioned approach was put right thru doco all code and variable refs woul dbe code style rather than parapgraph style making it easier to identify code.
pp36 - refs table 4.2 shld be 3.2

CHAPTER_4
pps=x CAUTION para. font style/size needs correction
