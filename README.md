# Freebasic_user_guide
The is an update of the book "A Beginner's Guide To FreeBasic" by Richard D. Clark and Ebben Feagan. This book was released to the Community. Our goal is to update this book to the current version of FreeBasic. 

<start>
The content in these pages are a fork of https://github.com/patrickw99/Freebasic_user_guide by me for the purpose of updating the source files to match the PDF of the book, make some minor corrections to the sources then submit the changes for review.  It is my hope that the proposed changes will then be accepted and pulled into patrickw99's master copy and a revised PDF produced.  Provide the changes are accepted, my intention is then to work through and update the book's existing content to bring it in line with FreeBasic 1.05/1.06  and wit furter work, to eventually fully eventually support 1.06 in it's entirety.

For now, the goal is to
1 review the sources and synchronise that content with the PDF
2 work through the sources to indentify any errors and update the sources
  in my first pass though chapters 1-7 I found a large number of conjoined words in the sources.  I used ooo2.2.1 & LibreOffice 6.x.x.x
  to check the osurces with the same result in both (ooo as i believe that might have been used to construct the book sources)
3 work through each chapter and identify any further errors.
  in my first pass though chapters 1-7 I found 6 or 7 corrections needed so i will document those as i go
  check programming examples for minor errors (looking for actual errors as there are some intentional errors built in) 
4 do a spell check & grammar check using LibreOffice 6.x.x.x to make minor spelling & structural corrections

At the end of this process i should have an updated set of ODT sources (1) with minor corrections (2,3) and some objective/subjective 
  mods (4) to submit the end result for review by the FreeBasic forum members.

Then if i am feeling motivated, i would like to  
- _update the existing content_ in line with FreeBasic v1.05/1.06
- identify _what needs to be added to fill in the gaps_ between FreeBasic v0.17 and v1.05/1.06

I recently found a nice set of tutorials at http://www.frankticfreebasic.com/ which would be nice to include or merge in with the author's consent, initially about using FBedit as beginnner's tools to writing, compiling and testing code or the FBC command line to compile code.
